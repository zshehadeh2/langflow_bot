We’re seeing a 30-minute delay in logs appearing in Splunk for the checkout-service.

Thanks Maya. This could be due to ingestion queue backlog or indexer performance. We’ll need to check Splunk metrics and possibly scale ingestion.

Creating a Jira ticket to investigate and work with the Observability team.
