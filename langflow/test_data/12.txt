Versioning Clarification
[DevTeam_Eric | 3:00 PM]
Quick question — should the next release of inventory-service be 1.5.0 or 2.0.0? We’re introducing a new API endpoint.

[ReleaseTeam_Sophia | 3:03 PM]
If the new endpoint is backward-compatible, 1.5.0 is fine. If it breaks existing clients, we should bump to 2.0.0.

[DevTeam_Eric | 3:05 PM]
It’s additive and doesn’t affect existing behavior. We’ll go with 1.5.0 then.

[ReleaseTeam_Sophia | 3:06 PM]
Perfect. I’ll update the release notes accordingly.
