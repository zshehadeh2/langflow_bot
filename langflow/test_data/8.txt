Build Cache Corruption
[ModuleTeam_Luis | 3:30 PM]
Our Gradle builds are failing intermittently. Clearing the cache helps, but it keeps coming back.

Sounds like the shared build cache might be corrupted or misconfigured. We’ll need to investigate the cache server and possibly reset it.

Logging a Jira ticket to track this and coordinate with the Build Engineering team.
