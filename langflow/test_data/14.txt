Release Blocker Identified
[ReleaseTeam_Emily | 2:30 PM]
Starting prep for the 2.3.0 release. Any last-minute blockers?

[DevTeam_Ravi | 2:32 PM]
Hold on — we just found a bug in the discount logic during staging validation. It’s applying the wrong rate for bulk orders.

[ReleaseTeam_Emily | 2:33 PM]
Thanks for the heads-up. Let’s pause the release. Can you estimate how long the fix will take?

[DevTeam_Ravi | 2:35 PM]
Already working on it. Should have a fix ready in 30–45 minutes.

[ReleaseTeam_Emily | 2:36 PM]
Okay, we’ll reschedule the release to 4 PM pending your fix and QA sign-off.
