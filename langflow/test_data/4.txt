ðŸ§µ Example 2: GitHub Pipeline Issue
[ModuleTeam_Sara | 11:03 AM]
Our GitHub pipeline is failing at the upload-artifact step with this error:
Error: Artifact upload failed: The artifact size exceeds the limit of 2 GB.

Hey Sara, GitHub has a 2 GB limit per artifact. Are you uploading a full build directory?

[ModuleTeam_Sara | 11:07 AM]
Yes, it includes logs, binaries, and test reports.

You might want to split the artifact into smaller chunks or exclude unnecessary files. Try this in your workflow:

- name: Upload test reports
Â  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
Â  with:
Â Â Â  name: test-reports
Â Â Â  path: reports/



And exclude large binaries unless needed.

Got it. Split the artifacts and it worked. Thanks!
