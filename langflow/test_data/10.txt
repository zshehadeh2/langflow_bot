GitHub Actions Rate Limiting
[ModuleTeam_Tom | 11:40 AM]
We’re hitting GitHub API rate limits during our workflows. It’s slowing down our deployments.

Thanks for flagging. This might be due to unauthenticated API calls or excessive parallel jobs. We’ll need to audit usage and possibly request a higher quota.

Creating a Jira ticket to investigate and coordinate with GitHub support if needed.
