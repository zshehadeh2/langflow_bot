 Example 4: Build Issue
[ModuleTeam_Jin | 3:30 PM]
Our Maven build is failing with:
Could not resolve dependencies for project: Could not find artifact com.example:lib-utils:jar:1.2.3

[DevOps_Arjun | 3:33 PM]
Hi Jin, is that artifact hosted in a private repo?

[ModuleTeam_Jin | 3:34 PM]
Yes, in our internal Nexus.

[DevOps_Arjun | 3:36 PM]
Check if the Nexus repo URL is configured in your settings.xml. Also, make sure the credentials are set in the GitHub secrets if you're using them in the pipeline.

[ModuleTeam_Jin | 3:45 PM]
Ah, the credentials were missing. Added them and it works now. Thanks!
