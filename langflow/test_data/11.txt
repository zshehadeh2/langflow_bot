Runner Resource Exhaustion
[ModuleTeam_Anya | 9:15 AM]
Our builds are randomly failing with out of memory errors on the self-hosted runners. Can we increase the memory allocation?

Hey Anya, sounds like the runners are hitting their memory limits. We’ll need to evaluate the current VM specs and possibly resize them.

This will require coordination with the Infra team. I’ll open a Jira ticket to track the resource upgrade and notify you once it’s scheduled.
