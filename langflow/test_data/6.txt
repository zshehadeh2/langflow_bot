
ðŸ§µ Example 5: Splunk Logging Issue
[ModuleTeam_Nora | 4:10 PM]
Weâ€™re not seeing any logs from the auth-service in Splunk since yesterday. Nothing in the auth-prod index.

Hey Nora, checking the forwarder config now. Was there a recent deployment?

[ModuleTeam_Nora | 4:13 PM]
Yes, we deployed a new version yesterday morning.

[DevOps_Tariq | 4:17 PM]
Looks like the Splunk forwarder config was overwritten. Iâ€™ll redeploy the correct config and restart the forwarder.

[DevOps_Tariq | 4:25 PM]
Done. Logs should start flowing in a few minutes.

[ModuleTeam_Nora | 4:30 PM]
Confirmed â€” logs are back. Appreciate the quick fix!
