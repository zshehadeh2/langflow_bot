ðŸ§µ Example 1: Infrastructure Issue in Runner
[ModuleTeam_Ravi | 10:12 AM]
Hey DevOps, our GitHub Actions runner is stuck on the checkout step. It just hangs and times out. Any idea whatâ€™s going on?

Hi Ravi! Is this happening on a self-hosted runner or GitHub-hosted?

[ModuleTeam_Ravi | 10:15 AM]
Self-hosted, in the ci-runners group.

Thanks. I just checked â€” the runner VM is up but the GitHub runner service isnâ€™t responding. Restarting the service now.

[DevOps_Lena | 10:21 AM]
Service restarted. Can you re-run the job?

[ModuleTeam_Ravi | 10:25 AM]
Yep, that fixed it. Thanks!
