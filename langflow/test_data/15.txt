Hi team, just a reminder that we’re targeting the 2.3.0 release for orders-service today at 3 PM EST. Please confirm if your changes are merged and tested.

Hey Emily, my PR for the new discount logic is merged and passed QA. Good to go from my side.

[DevTeam_Lina | 9:07 AM]
Same here — the logging improvements are in and verified.

Great, thanks! I’ll start the release prep at 2:30 PM and ping here before the deployment begins.
