Hotfix Coordination
[DevTeam_Nora | 11:15 AM]
We need to push a hotfix for auth-service. A login regression was reported in production this morning.

[ReleaseTeam_James | 11:17 AM]
Understood. Is the fix ready and tested?

[DevTeam_Nora | 11:20 AM]
Yes, it’s in the hotfix/login-bug branch. QA approved it 10 minutes ago.

[ReleaseTeam_James | 11:25 AM]
I’ll prep a patch release v1.8.1 and deploy to production in the next 15 minutes. Will update here once it’s live.

[DevTeam_Nora | 11:40 AM]
Thanks, James. I’ll monitor the logs post-deploy.
