Hey DevOps, our CI pipeline for the payments-service is failing during the Docker build step. Getting an error:
failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c npm install" did not complete successfully.

Any ideas?

[DevOps_Jay | 9:05 AM]
Hi Alice! That error usually means something went wrong during the npm install step. Could you share the full logs from the build step?

[ModuleTeam_Alice | 9:07 AM]
Sure, here’s the tail end of the log:

npm ERR! code EAI_AGAIN
npm ERR! syscall getaddrinfo
npm ERR! errno EAI_AGAIN
npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/ failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN
[DevOps_Jay | 9:10 AM]
Thanks! That EAI_AGAIN error usually indicates a DNS resolution issue. Is this happening consistently or intermittently?

[ModuleTeam_Alice | 9:11 AM]
It’s been happening consistently since this morning. We didn’t change anything in the Dockerfile.

[DevOps_Jay | 9:13 AM]
Got it. Are you using a self-hosted runner or GitHub-hosted runners?

[ModuleTeam_Alice | 9:14 AM]
Self-hosted runner on our internal Kubernetes cluster.

[DevOps_Jay | 9:17 AM]
Okay, that helps. We had a DNS issue in the cluster earlier today. Can you try adding this to your Dockerfile temporarily to see if it resolves the issue?


Let me know if that works.

[ModuleTeam_Alice | 9:25 AM]
Tried that, but still getting the same error. Could it be a network policy issue?

[DevOps_Jay | 9:28 AM]
Possibly. Let me check the network policies applied to your namespace. What’s the namespace name?

[ModuleTeam_Alice | 9:29 AM]
payments-dev

[DevOps_Jay | 9:35 AM]
Confirmed — there’s a new egress policy applied this morning that restricts external traffic. I’ll update it to allow access to registry.npmjs.org.

[ModuleTeam_Alice | 9:42 AM]
Awesome, thanks! Just retried the pipeline and it passed. Appreciate the help!

[DevOps_Jay | 9:43 AM]
Glad to hear it! I’ll document this in the runbook. Let us know if anything else comes up.
