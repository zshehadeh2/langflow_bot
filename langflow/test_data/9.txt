Python Dependency Conflicts
[ModuleTeam_Eric | 2:05 PM]
Our pipeline fails with pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound when running tests. Looks like a dependency mismatch.

This might be due to conflicting versions in your requirements.txt and the base image. We’ll need to standardize Python environments across services.

I’ll open a Jira ticket to define a base Python image strategy and align dependencies across teams.
